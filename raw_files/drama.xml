   <text><!-- this template has been based off the following publicly available TEI resources: Women Writers Project Online: http://www.wwp.northeastern.edu/research/publications/guide/html/drama_outline.html -->
     <front>
        <div type="castlist"><!-- in most cases, works of drama will include a Cast List, or Dramatis Personae, in the front matter of the published work. We can mark this section of source document under a custom <div> with @type value of "castlist." It is recommended and often the practice to add a Cast List in cases even where there isn't one in published edition: see WWP's recommendations and <hyperDiv> discussion: http://www.wwp.northeastern.edu/research/publications/guide/html/drama_castList.html  -->
           <castList><!-- the TEI offers an element <castList> to markup the Cast List, and includes a <head> followed by a <castItem> for each character entry, and often grouped together under each <castGroup>. -->
              <head><!-- Dramatis Personae -->The Persons of the Play</head>
              <castGroup><!-- Cast Lists are often divided into Cast Groups, often by gender. We can add <castGroup> as a child of <castList>, with <head> under each <castGroup> to declare the grouping type: <castList><castGroup><head>Women</head><castItem> ... </castItem></castGroup></castList> In our example here, however, we find a divided cast list by gender that is not directly stated by a grouping title, so we will forgo the use of <head>...</head> in each <castGroup>.-->
                 <castItem><!-- used for each character entry in Cast List -->
