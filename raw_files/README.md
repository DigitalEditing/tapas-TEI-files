# tapas-TEI-files/templates/
Source TEI files from which samples and templates for use in TAPAS are generated

Welcome!

This folder holds “uber” TEI files from each of which a sample file can be created (by deleting the informative comments) or a template file can be created (by deleting the sample content).
