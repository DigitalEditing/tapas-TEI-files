            series of two or more discrete XML elements, as a work-around for overlap problems.
            These attributes represent the connections between these fragmentary elements, by
            pointing to a prior or subsequent element in the chain of fragments. They do so by
            referring to that element’s <att>xml:id</att> value. That is, if <att>next</att> is
            specified on a <gi>said</gi> element, then its value should be a hash mark
              (<code>#</code>) followed by the value of the <att>xml:id</att> of another
              <gi>said</gi> element, the one that is the next part of the spoken passage. For
            example, <code>&lt;said xml:id="s01" next="#s02"&gt;Hey&lt;/said&gt;, he

            <att>met</att>
          </label>

          <label>
            <att>n</att>
          </label>
          <item>Provides a label or identifier for this particular element, not necessarily

          <label><att>next</att> and <att>prev</att></label>
          <item>Allow what is logically a single text object (e.g. a quotation) to be encoded as a
            series of two or more discrete XML elements, as a work-around for overlap problems.
            These attributes represent the connections between these fragmentary elements, by
            pointing to a prior or subsequent element in the chain of fragments. They do so by
            referring to that element’s <att>xml:id</att> value. That is, if <att>next</att> is
            specified on a <gi>said</gi> element, then its value should be a hash mark
              (<code>#</code>) followed by the value of the <att>xml:id</att> of another
              <gi>said</gi> element, the one that is the next part of the spoken passage. For
            example, <code>&lt;said xml:id="s01" next="#s02"&gt;Hey&lt;/said&gt;, he
              said, &lt;said xml:id="s02" prev="#s01"&gt;What's

          <label>
            <att>rhyme</att>

          <item>May be used to specify the rhyme scheme of a line group.</item>
          <label>
            <att>target</att>
          </label>
          <item>Provides a URI (e.g.
              <code>http://bauman.zapto.org/gallery/Niagara_Falls_2008-01/2008_01_07T16_35_39</code>
            or <code>#sect08</code>) that points to either another document or an element within an

          <label>
            <att>xml:id</att>

          <item>Provides a unique identifier for this particular element, thus allowing other

          <label>
            <att>met</att>
          </label>
          <item>May be used to specify the metrical pattern a line (or line group).</item>
          <label>
            <att>n</att>
          </label>
          <item>Provides a label or identifier for this particular element, not necessarily
            unique.</item>
          <label><att>next</att> and <att>prev</att></label>
          <item>Allow what is logically a single text object (e.g. a quotation) to be encoded as a
            series of two or more discrete XML elements, as a work-around for overlap problems.
            These attributes represent the connections between these fragmentary elements, by
            pointing to a prior or subsequent element in the chain of fragments. They do so by
            referring to that element’s <att>xml:id</att> value. That is, if <att>next</att> is
            specified on a <gi>said</gi> element, then its value should be a hash mark
              (<code>#</code>) followed by the value of the <att>xml:id</att> of another
              <gi>said</gi> element, the one that is the next part of the spoken passage. For
            example, <code>&lt;said xml:id="s01" next="#s02"&gt;Hey&lt;/said&gt;, he
              said, &lt;said xml:id="s02" prev="#s01"&gt;What's
              up?&lt;/said&gt;</code>.</item>
          <label>
            <att>rend</att>
          </label>
          <item>May be used to specify how the element looked in the source. E.g., <tag>head
              rend="align(center)"</tag> or <tag>l rend="indent(2)"</tag>.</item>
          <label>
            <att>rhyme</att>
          </label>
          <item>May be used to specify the rhyme scheme of a line group.</item>
          <label>
            <att>target</att>
          </label>
          <item>Provides a URI (e.g.
              <code>http://bauman.zapto.org/gallery/Niagara_Falls_2008-01/2008_01_07T16_35_39</code>
            or <code>#sect08</code>) that points to either another document or an element within an
            XML document (including the current one).</item>
          <label>
            <att>xml:id</att>
          </label>
          <item>Provides a unique identifier for this particular element, thus allowing other
            elements to point to it (using their <att>target</att>, <att>next</att>,
            <att>prev</att>, etc.).</item>
          <label>
            <att>xml:lang</att>
          </label>
          <item>Used to indicate the language of an element’s content. Its value conforms to BCP 47
            (a standard system for defining language codes). For information on how BCP 47 codes are
