	<head>THIS WORLD</head>
	<div type="section">
	  <head>Of the Nature of Flatland</head>
	  <p>I call our world Flatland, not because we call it so, but
	  to make its nature clearer to you, my happy readers, who are
	  privileged to live in Space.</p>
	  <p>Imagine a vast sheet of paper on which straight Lines,
	  Triangles, Squares, Pentagons, Hexagons, and other figures,
	  instead of remaining fixed in their places, move freely
	  about, on or in the surface, but without the power of rising
	  above or sinking below it, very much like shadows—only hard
	  with luminous edges—and you will then have a pretty correct
	  notion of my country and countrymen. Alas, a few years ago,
	  I should have said “my universe:” but now my mind has been
	  opened to higher views of things.</p>
	  <p>In such a country, you will perceive at once that it is
	  impossible that there should be anything of what you call a
	  “solid” kind; but I dare say you will suppose that we could
	  at least distinguish by sight the Triangles, Squares, and
	  other figures, moving about as I have described them. On the
	  contrary, we could see nothing of the kind, not at least so
	  as to <pb n="4" facs="page_images/017-047.jpg"/>distinguish one figure from another. Nothing was
	  visible, nor could be visible, to us, except Straight Lines;
	  and the necessity of this I will speedily demonstrate.</p>
	  <p>Place a penny on the middle of one of your tables in
	  Space; and leaning over it, look down upon it. It will
	  appear a circle.</p>
	  <p>But now, drawing back to the edge of the table, gradually
	  lower your eye (thus bringing yourself more and more into
	  the condition of the inhabitants of Flatland), and you will
	  find the penny becoming more and more oval to your view, and
	  at last when you have placed your eye exactly on the edge of
	  the table (so that you are, as it were, actually a
	  Flatlander) the penny will then have ceased to appear oval
	  at all, and will have become, so far as you can see, a
	  straight line.</p>
	  <p>The same thing would happen if you were to treat in the
	  same way a Triangle, or a Square, or any other figure cut
	  out from pasteboard. As soon as you look at it with your eye
	  on the edge of the table, you will find that it ceases to
	  appear to you as a figure, and that it becomes in appearance
	  a straight line. Take for example an equilateral
	  Triangle—who represents with us a Tradesman of the
	  respectable class. Figure 1 represents the Tradesman as you
	  would see him while you were bending over him from above;
	  figures 2 and 3 represent the Tradesman, as you would see
	  him if your eye were close to the level, or all but on the
	  level of the table; and if your eye were quite on the level
	  of the table (and that is how we see him in Flatland) you
	  would see nothing but a straight line.</p>
	  <p>When I was in Spaceland I heard that your sailors have
	  very similar experiences while they traverse your seas and
	  discern some distant island<pb n="5" facs="page_images/018-050.jpg"/>or coast lying on the horizon.
	  The far-off land may have bays, forelands, angles in and out
	  to any number and extent; yet at a distance you see none of
	  these (unless indeed your sun shines bright upon them
	  revealing the projections and retirements by means of light
	  and shade), nothing but a grey unbroken line upon the
	  water.</p>
	  <p>Well, that is just what we see when one of our triangular
	  or other acquaintances comes towards us in Flatland. As
	  there is neither sun with us, nor any light of such a kind
	  as to make shadows, we have none of the helps to the sight
	  that you have in Spaceland. If our friend comes closer to us
	  we see his line becomes larger; if he leaves us it becomes
	  smaller; but still he looks like a straight line; be he a
	  Triangle, Square, Pentagon, Hexagon, Circle, what you
	  will—a straight Line he looks and nothing else.</p>
	  <p>You may perhaps ask how under these disadvantagous
	  circumstances we are able to distinguish our friends from
	  one another: but the answer to this very natural question
	  will be more fitly and easily given when I come to describe
	  the inhabitants of Flatland. For the present let me defer
	  this subject, and say a word or two about the climate and
	  houses in our country.</p>
	</div>
	<div type="section">
	  <head>Of the Climate and Houses in Flatland</head>
	  <p>As with you, so also with us, there are four points of
	  the compass North, South, East, and West.</p>
	  <p>There being no sun nor other heavenly bodies, it is
	  impossible for us to determine the North in the usual way;
	  but we have a method of our own. By a Law of Nature with us,
	  there is a constant attraction to the South; and, although
	  in temperate climates this is very slight—so that even a
	  Woman in reasonable health can journey several furlongs
	  northward without much difficulty—yet the hampering effort
	  of the southward attraction is quite sufficient to serve as
	  a compass in most parts of our earth. Moreover,
	  <pb n="6" facs="page_images/019-053.jpg"/>the rain
	  (which falls at stated intervals) coming always from the
	  North, is an additional assistance; and in the towns we have
	  the guidance of the houses, which of course have their
	  side-walls running for the most part North and South, so
	  that the roofs may keep off the rain from the North. In the
	  country, where there are no houses, the trunks of the trees
	  serve as some sort of guide. Altogether, we have not so much
	  difficulty as might be expected in determining our
	  bearings.</p>
	  <p>Yet in our more temperate regions, in which the southward
	  attraction is hardly felt, walking sometimes in a perfectly
	  desolate plain where there have been no houses nor trees to
	  guide me, I have been occasionally compelled to remain
	  stationary for hours together, waiting till the rain came
	  before continuing my journey. On the weak and aged, and
	  especially on delicate Females, the force of attraction
	  tells much more heavily than on the robust of the Male Sex,
	  so that it is a point of breeding, if you meet a Lady on the
	  street, always to give her the North side of the way—by no
	  means an easy thing to do always at short notice when you
	  are in rude health and in a climate where it is difficult to
	  tell your North from your South.</p>
	  <p>Windows there are none in our houses: for the light comes
	  to us alike in our homes and out of them, by day and by
	  night, equally at all times and in all places, whence we
	  know not. It was in old days, with our learned men, an
	  interesting and oft-investigate question, “What is the
	  origin of light?” and the solution of it has been repeatedly
	  attempted, with no other result than to crowd our lunatic
	  asylums with the would-be solvers. Hence, after fruitless
	  attempts to suppress such investigations indirectly by
	  making them liable to a heavy tax, the Legislature, in
	  comparatively recent times, absolutely prohibited them.
	  I—alas, I alone in Flatland—know now only too well the
	  true solution of this mysterious problem; but my knowledge
	  cannot be made intelligible to a single one of my
	  countrymen; and I am mocked at—I,
	  <pb n="7" facs="page_images/020-056.jpg"/>the sole possessor of the
	  truths of Space and of the theory of the introduction of
	  Light from the world of three Dimensions—as if I were the
	  maddest of the mad! But a truce to these painful
	  digressions: let me return to our homes.</p>
