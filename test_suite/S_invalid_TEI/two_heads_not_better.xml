      <!-- Zaphod Beeblebrox or Donald Trump? -->

	<item><quote>He had rather liked Zaphod Beeblebrox in a
	strange sort of way. He was clearly a man of many quallities,
	even if they were mostly bad ones.</quote></item>
	<item><quote>One of the major difficulties Trillian
	experienced in her relationship with Zaphod was learning to
	distinguish between him pretending to be stupid just to get
	people off their guard, pretending to be stupid because he
	couldn't be bothered to think and wanted someone else to do it
	for him, pretending to be outrageously stupid to hide the fact
	that he actually didn’t understand what was going on, and
	really being genuinely stupid. He was renowned for being
	amazingly clever and quite clearly was so—but not all the
	time, which obviously worried him, hence, the act. He
	preferred people to be puzzled rather than
	contemptuous.</quote></item>
	<item><quote
	source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaphod_Beeblebrox#As_a_character">As
	a character, Zaphod is hedonistic and irresponsible,
	narcissistic almost to the point of solipsism, and often
	extremely insensitive to the feelings of those around him. In
	the books and radio series, he is nevertheless quite
	charismatic which causes many characters to ignore his other
	flaws.</quote></item>
