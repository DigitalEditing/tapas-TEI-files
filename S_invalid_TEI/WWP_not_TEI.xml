      <p><rs rend="slant(italic)"><hi rend="case(mixed)">Mr</hi>. Speaker</rs>, We perceive, your coming is to preſent Thanks to
Us; Know I
<lb/>accept them with no leſs Joy, than your Loves can have a
deſire to offer ſuch
<lb/>a preſent; and do more eſteem it than any treaſure or
riches. For the value of
<lb/>Them I know, but Loyalty, Love and Thanks I account unvaluable;
and though
<lb/>God hath raiſed Me high, yet this I account
the Glory of My Crown, that I have
<lb/>Reigned with your Loves. This makes Me that I do not ſo much
rejoyce, that
<lb/>God hath made me a Queen, as to be a Queen of
ſo thankful a people, and to be
<lb/>a means under God, to conſerve you in
ſafety, and to preſerve you from danger;
<lb/>yea, to be an Inſtrument to preſerve you from diſhonour,
ſhame and infamy; to
<lb/>keep you out of ſervitude and ſlavery under Our Enemies, and
cruel tyranny
<lb/>and vile oppreſſion intended againſt Us. For the better
withſtanding whereof,
<lb/>We take very acceptably your intended Supplies; and chiefly, that
it manifeſteth
<lb/>your Love and Largeneſs of heart to your Sovereign. Of My Self I
was never
<lb/>a greedy ſcraping graſper, nor ſtrict faſt-holding Prince,
nor yet a Waſter. My
<lb/>heart was never ſet upon any wordly goods; but what you beſtow
on Me, I
<lb/>will not hoard it up, but receive it, to beſtow on you
again. Yea, my own pro­
<lb/>perties I account yours, to be expended for your good, and your
Eyes ſhall ſee
<lb/>the beſtowing of it for your welfare.</p>
      <p><rs rend="slant(italic)"><hi rend="case(mixed)">Mr</hi>. Speaker</rs>, I wiſh you and the
reſt of the Gentlemen to ſtand up, for I fear I
<lb/>ſhall yet trouble you with a longer Speech.</p>

      <p>Mr. <hi rend="slant(italic)">Speaker</hi>, You give Me thanks, but
I am more to thank you, and I charge
<lb/>you thank them of the Lower Houſe from me; for had I not
received knowledge
<lb/>from you, I might have fallen into the lapſe of an errour, only
for want of true
<lb/>Information. Since I was a Queen, I never yet put my Pen to any
Grant, but
<lb/>upon pretext and ſemblance made, that it was for the good and
avail of My Sub­
<lb/>jects in General, though a private profit to ſome of my antient
ſervants, who
<lb/>have deſerved well. But that any Grant of Mine, ſhall be made
grievous to My
<lb/>people, and oppreſſion to be priviledg'd under the Colour of
our Patents, Our
<lb/>Princely Dignity ſhall not ſuffer it. When I heard it, I could
give no reſt to
<lb/>My thoughts; and thoſe Varlets, lewd perſons, abuſers of My
Bounty ſhall know,
<lb/>I will not ſuffer it. And <rs rend="slant(italic)"><hi rend="case(mixed)">Mr</hi>. Speaker</rs>, Tell the Houſe from Me, That I
take it
<lb/>exceeding grateful, that the knowledge of theſe are come unto Me
from them:
<lb/>and though amongſt them the principal members are ſuch as are
not touched
<lb/>in private, and therefore ſpeak not from any feeling of the
grief, yet We have
<lb/>heard, That other Gentlemen alſo of the Houſe who ſtand as
free, have ſpoken as
<lb/>freely in it. Which gives Us to know, that no reſpects of
Intereſts have moved
<lb/>them, otherwiſe than what they bear to ſuffer the diminution
of Our Honor, and
<lb/>Our Subjects Love to Us. The zeal of which affection tending to
eaſe My people
<lb/>and knit their hearts to Us, I embrace with a Princely care; for
above all other
<lb/>treaſures, I eſteem My peoples love, more than which, I
deſire not to merit: and God
<lb/>that gave me to ſit, and placed Me over you, knows, That I never
reſpected My,
<lb/>but as your good was concerned in Me. Yea, What dangers! What
perils!
<lb/>What practices I have paſt, ſome if not all of you know; but
none of thoſe
<lb/>things ever moved me, or made me fear, but it's
God that hath delivered Me.
</p>
      <p>And in governing this Land, I have ever ſet the laſt Judgement
day before
<lb/>My eyes, and ſo to rule, as I ſhall be judged and anſwer
before a higher Judge,
<lb/>to whoſe Judgement Seat I do appeal, That never thought was
cheriſhed in My
<lb/>heart, that tended not to My peoples good. And if My Princely
Bounty hath
<lb/>been abuſed, and my Grace turned to the Hurt of My people
contrary to My
<lb/>Will and Meaning, or if any Authority under Me have neglected, or
converted
<lb/>what I committed to them from My deſign, I hope God will not lay
their Culp
<lb/>upon My charge.</p>
      <p>To be a King, and wear a Crown, is a thing more Glorious to them
that ſee
<lb/>it, than it is pleaſant to them that bear it. For My Self, I was
never ſo much
<lb/>inticed with the Glorious Name of a King, or the Royal Authority
of a Queen,
<lb/>as delighted, that God made me his
Inſtrument to maintain his Truth and Glory,
<lb/>and defend this Kingdom from diſhonor, damage, Tyranny and
oppreſſion.</p>
      <p>But ſhould I aſcribe theſe things to My Self or to My Sexly
weakneſs, I were
<lb/>not worthy to live; and of all moſt unworthy of the Mercies I
have received at
<lb/>Gods hands: but to God
alone, and to him wholly is all given and aſcribed.</p>
      <p>The Cares and troubles of a Crown, I cannot more fitly reſemble,
than to the
<lb/>Druggs of an Apothecary perfumed with ſome Aromatical favour, or
bitter Pills
<lb/>gilded over, by which they are made acceptable or leſs
offenſive, when indeed they
<lb/>are bitter and unpleaſant. As for My own part, were it not for
Conscience ſake
<lb/>to diſcharge the duty God hath laid upon
Me, and to maintain his Glory, and
<lb/>keep you in ſafety, in my diſpoſition I ſhould be willing
to Reſign that place I hold
<lb/>to any other, and be glad to be freed of the Glory with the
labour. For it is
<lb/>not My deſire to Live and Reign longer, than My Life and Reign
ſhall be for
<lb/>your good; and though you have had, and may have Mightier and
Wiſer Princes
<lb/>ſitting on this Seat, yet you never had, nor ſhall have any that
will love you
<lb/>better.</p>
      <p>Thus <rs rend="slant(italic)"><hi rend="case(mixed)">Mr</hi>. Speaker</rs>, I commend Me to
your Loyal Loves, and yours to My beſt
<lb/>Care and your further Counſels. And I pray you <rs rend="slant(italic)"><hi rend="case(mixed)">Mr</hi>. Controller</rs>
and <rs rend="slant(italic)"><hi rend="case(mixed)">Mr</hi>. Secretary</rs>,
<lb/>and you of My Council, that before theſe Gentlemen depart into
the Countrey,
<lb/>you bring them all to Kiſs My Hand.</p>
