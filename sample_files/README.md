# tapas-TEI-files/sample_files/
Sample TEI files for use in TAPAS

Hello!

This directory holds sample TEI files that may be played with in TAPAS. Each of these files should be valid TEI, and should look reasonably good in at least one TAPAS viewpackage.

These files are generated from the files in ../raw_files/ (and then possiblly hand-tweaked). Thus you probably don't want to make any changes here.
