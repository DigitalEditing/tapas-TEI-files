# tapas-TEI-files/templates/
TEI templates for use in TAPAS

Welcome!

This folder holds templates of TEI files which, when filled out, should work at least reasonably well in at least one TAPAS viewpackage. 

These files are generated from the files in ../raw_files/ (and then possiblly hand-tweaked). Thus you probably don't want to make any changes here.
