# tapas-TEI-test-suite
TEI test files (and expected results)


Doubt this arrangement will remain, for now:

* **F** = _fatal_: ill-formed, not XML
* **S** = _severe_: invalid TEI (including not in TEI namespace)
* **E** = _error_: valid, but rejected by TAPAS
* **W** = _warning_: acceptable, but likely won't do what's intended
* **D** = _debug_: poor practice detected
* **P** = _pass_: should pass all tests

Files are likely to change directories when we change our minds about
processing.
