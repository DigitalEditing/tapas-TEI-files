      <salute>Dear Paul,</salute>
      <p>How's London? I just want to interrupt your tea for a moment
      to let you know what's been happening since you left. You know
      it kills me that you're in London now, goofing, while I'm here
      with three term papers ahead of me. And the album's sitting
      waiting downtown at CBS in our cubby.</p>
      <p>Two things before I forget: Did you find a scooter for us?
      Call up that number I gave you, the guy knows all about these
      sort of things--he'll be very helpful. I expect to see you and
      the machine in Paris when I come after finals. Also send me the
      chords to <title>Wednesday Morning</title> because I expect to
      do singles at Gerde's for a few nights.</p>
      <p>Tom asked me yesterday if I would write the album notes. I
      told him I thought the author should explain his own songs but
      I'm reconsidering. In fact, it's a very pleasant task. I know
      how you feel about this, but I (your greatest advocate) want as
      many as possible to understand as much as possible. Please
      understand that mine is the difficult position more than
      slightly analogous to the man who received Franz Kafka's dying
      request to burn all his manuscripts, but who nonetheless felt
      obliged to rush off to the publisher at his first chance. The
      point is that you understanding the songs, me believing in their
      worth, and Columbia recording them, is really not sufficient. So
      I decided last night to write the following as a
      <soCalled>listener's guide</soCalled> to the songs:
      <floatingText>
	<body>
	  <p>I first heard <title>He Was My Brother</title> in June
	  1963, the week after Paul Simon wrote it. Cast in the Bob
	  Dylan mold of that time there was no subtlety in the song,
	  no sophistication in the lyric; rather, the innocent voice
	  of an uncomfortable youth. The ending is joyously optimistic
	  I was happy to feel the way the song made me feel. It was
	  clearly the product of considerable talent.</p>
	  <p>In September 1963, I returned from Berkeley, California,
	  where I had spent the summer. Paul had just completed
	  <title>Sparrow</title> and was already working on the third
	  song. With <title>Sparrow</title> begins much of the style
	  that characterizes all the later work. The clarity of the
	  song's structure is matched by the simplicity of its
	  subject. The song is asking: <q>Who will love?</q> Poetic
	  personification is used for the answers: Greed (<q>the oak
	  tree</q>), Vanity (<q>the swan</q>), Hypocrisy (<q>the wheat</q>).</p>
	  <p>I was greatly impressed with <title>Sparrow</title>, and
	  I arranged the two songs for us. We sang at Folk City that
	  night and formed the partnership.</p>
	  <p>I confess that <title>Bleecker Street</title> (finished
	  in October 1963), was too much for me at first The song is
	  highly intellectual, the symbolism extremely challenging.
	  The opening line in which the fog comes like a <q>shroud</q>
	  over the city introduces the theme of <term>creative
	  sterility.</term> But it is the second verse which I find
	  particularly significant:
	  <quote rend="italic">
	    <l>Voices leaking from a sad cafe</l>
	    <l>Smiling faces try to understand</l>
	    <l>I saw a shadow touch a shadow's hand</l>
	    <l>On Bleecker Street</l>
	  </quote>
	  The first line is a purely poetic image. The second line
	  touches poignantly on human conditions of our time. To me,
	  it shows the same perceptive psychological characterization
	  as <title>Sparrow</title>--the <q>golden wheat</q> (<quote>I
	  would it I could but I cannot, I know</quote>). The third
	  line marks the first appearance of a theme that is to occupy
	  great attention in later work--<q>lack of
	  communication.</q></p>
	  <p>The author says that the poets have <q>sold out</q>
	  (<quote>the poet writes his crooked rhyme</quote>). The line
	  <quote>Thirty dollars pays your rent</quote> reminds one of
	  Judas Iscariot's betrayal of Christ for thirty pieces of
	  silver. Admittedly, the song is difficult to understand, but
	  worth the effort.</p>
	  <p>The <title>Sounds of Silence</title> is a major work. We
	  were looking for a song on a larger scale, but this was more
	  than either of us expected. Paul had the theme and the
	  melody set in November, but three months of frustrating
	  attempts were necessary before the song <soCalled>burst
	  forth.</soCalled> On February 19, 1964, the song practically
	  wrote itself. Its theme is man's inability to communicate
	  with man. The author sees the extent of communication as it
	  is on only its most superficial and <q>commercial</q> level
	  (of which the <q>neon sign</q> is representative). There is
	  no serious understanding because there is no serious
	  communication--<quote>people talking without speaking--
	  hearing without listening</quote>. No one dares take the
	  risk of reaching out (<quote>take my arms that I might reach
	  you</quote>) to disturb the sound of silence. The poet's
	  attempts are equally futile (<quote>... but my words like
	  silent raindrops fell within the wells of silence</quote>).
	  The ending is an enigma. I find my own meaning in it, but
	  like most good works, it is best interpreted by each person
	  individually. The words tell us that when meaningful
	  communication fails, the only sound is silence.</p>
	  <p><title>Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.</title>, written in
	  April 1964, is a change of pace. The heightened intensity of
	  <title>The Sounds of Silence</title> has given way here to a
	  gentle mood, and the melody is once again a soft, smooth
	  vehicle. It is a painting that sets a scene, sketches some
	  details and quietly concludes.</p>
	</body>
      </floatingText>
      </p>
      <p>Paul--let me know what you think. I tried to be as honest as
      I can. You know how [I] [we] feel--there may or may not be a
      market for intellectuality, but there is your personal feel for
      the material, and ours for the performance.</p>
      <p>I promised I'd be down to the mastering next week to fight
      for the harmonica in <title>He Was My Brother</title>. (Making
      an album is lots of fun.)</p>
      <p>Listen, try and get us a job for when I come. And no singing
      in the streets.</p>
